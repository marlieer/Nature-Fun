### Introduction

Scout Island Nature Centre is a non-profit environmental educational centre located in Williams Lake, BC  Canada. Each summer, Scout Island employs summer students to develop and run summer programs for school-aged children, full of outdoor fun and learning. 

In the past the summer staff register children with pencil and paper with every day of summer programs is a separate page in the binder, resulting in hours spent flipping through the registration binder to sign children up. For example, if a child is registered for every Tuesday and Thursday morning of the summer, the parent must phone, email or come in person and the summer staff must write the child's information in the binder on each page for each individual session.

### Functionality

This website eliminates the repitition in registering repeat sessions for children by providing both parents and staff a web interface to register children for available summer sessions. Parents can view sessions online and register their children in available spots. They also have a dashboard summarizing upcoming sessions. Staff can register children and print reports of daily attendance from the site.
